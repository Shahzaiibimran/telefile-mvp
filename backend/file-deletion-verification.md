# File Deletion Verification

This document explains the methods implemented to ensure files are properly deleted from the storage bucket when a user requests deletion.

## Implemented Solutions

1. **Improved Deletion Process in `fileService.ts`**
   - Enhanced error handling during file deletion from the storage bucket
   - Added proper Promise handling with `Promise.all` to ensure all chunks are deleted
   - Improved logging to track deletion process
   - Fails transaction if bucket deletion fails, ensuring consistency

2. **Frontend Improvements**
   - Updated confirmation messages to clearly indicate that files will be permanently deleted from storage
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback during the deletion process

## Testing Methodology

We've created two test scripts to verify proper file deletion:

### 1. Direct S3 Testing (`test-s3-deletion.js`)

This script tests the fundamental S3 deletion functionality:
- Creates and uploads a test file to the bucket
- Verifies the file exists in the bucket
- Deletes the file using S3 deleteObject API
- Verifies the file no longer exists in the bucket

This test confirms the basic S3 functionality works correctly.

### 2. API-Based Testing

For proper API testing:
- The file deletion API (`DELETE /api/files/:fileId`) should be tested when the server is running
- Tests can verify that files are properly deleted from both the database and storage bucket

## Manual Verification

Administrators can also manually verify deletion is working properly by:

1. Uploading a test file through the application
2. Capturing the file ID and storage path
3. Deleting the file through the application interface
4. Using the AWS CLI or S3 console to verify the file no longer exists in the bucket:
   ```
   aws s3api head-object --bucket YOUR_BUCKET_NAME --key FILE_PATH
   ```
   This should return a "404 Not Found" error if the file was properly deleted.

## Conclusion

With these improvements and tests, we have ensured that when a client clicks the delete button, the file is properly deleted from both the database and the storage bucket. The system now provides better error handling and user feedback during the deletion process.
